# datastax-spark-sql-workshop

This is a 2-3 hour introductory workshop on DataStax Spark-SQL.

### Motivation

Tightly-integrated Spark-SQL is a key DSE capability that differentiates DataStax from competitors.  However, prospects often do not understand the capabilities of Spark-SQL, and do not know how to use it.  

This workshop helps prospects become familiar with Spark-SQL.  We take a "practitioner" approach, with minimal focus on internals.

### What is included?

Zeppelin notebooks, a pre-populated keyspace, executable code, and a corresponding presentation (with detailed speaker notes) walk the students through the most important capabilities of AlwaysOnSQL for database-centric applications.

* Basic SQL functionality for data analytics
* An OLTP Aggregation use case
* An ETL use case
* Java coding 

### Business Take Aways

Spark-SQL adds a crucial capability that is especially important to Business Analysts, Developers, and other stakeholders who want to leverage their SQL skills with DSE.

### Technical Take Aways

Spark-SQL adds a crucial capability that is not found in open-source Cassandra.
